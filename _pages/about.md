I am a 5th year Master Student at the [Paul G. Allen Center of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) graduating in Dec. 2022. I currently focus on Computer Graphics application design with passions that stem from [CSE 457](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse457/). I enjoy creating and visualizing simulated worlds based on real-world mathematics and physics. Check out my portfolio for these fun projects!
