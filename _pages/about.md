I am a 5th year Master Student at the [Paul G. Allen Center of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) graduating in June 2022. I currently focus on Computer Graphics application design with passions that stem from [CSE 457](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse457/). I enjoy creating and visualizing simulated worlds based on real-world mathematics and physics. Here is a artifact I created with my classmate Ru Guo using the animation application developed in this course.

<sup>Animated Newton's Cradle simulation using the graphics application developed in the [Animator project](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse457/20sp/src/animator/animator.php) of CSE457.</sup>

The whole structure is constructed using basic geometries including spheres, cylinder, cuboid, and surfaces. We implemented the lighting and shading procedures and the ray-tracing algorithm. In addition, the animation is created by setting up positions of different objects at different times. We also smoothed the movement by interpolating the movement curves using Bezier curves, Catmull-Rom splines, and B-splines.

Here is another artifact I created to show Hierarchical Modeling. You could see more clearly about the application's interface and the basic objects and light sources I used.
