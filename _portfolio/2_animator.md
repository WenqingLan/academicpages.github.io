Here is an artifact I created with my classmate Ru Guo using the animation application we developed in CSE457.

<sup>Animated Newton's Cradle simulation using the graphics application developed in the [Animator project](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse457/20sp/src/animator/animator.php) of CSE457.</sup>

The whole structure is constructed using basic geometries including spheres, cylinder, cuboid, and surfaces. We implemented the lighting and shading procedures and the ray-tracing algorithm. In addition, the animation is created by setting up positions of different objects at different times. We also smoothed the movement by interpolating the movement curves using Bezier curves, Catmull-Rom splines, and B-splines.
